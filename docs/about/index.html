I grew up in Pennsylvania, but have lived all over the United States. DC, NY, LA, SF, Austin and I'm currently in Miami.</p><p>I've been in entrepreneurship my whole life (my family ran their own RV dealership) and have been working in various startups for 18 years, from hospitality to SaaS, LLM and AI, and social apps. I also taught myself to code by making <a href="https://jenniferdewalt.com" target="_blank">180 websites in 180 days</a>.</p><p>I have a Masters of Fine Arts from Pratt Institute and an undergraduate degree from the University of Maryland. I also played volleyball at Maryland where we won the ACC tournament... twice. GO TERPS!</p><p>I believe everyone has the capacity to become the best version of themselves, and through that, we make the world a better place. Embrace what makes you awesome, what makes you, <em>you</em>, and run with it. I hope that reading Thinking Like a Jen helps you in your path toward self actualization. And if you're already there, I hope reading my thoughts gives you the space you need to continue on your path.</p><p>These musings are just that, musings. Please feel free to <a href="mailto:jen.dewalt@gmail.com">email</a> me with your thoughts. Also, if you would like to collaborate on something with me, please reach out!</p></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__content"><ul class="hero__social-links"><li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/jenniferdewalt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/jenniferdewalt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/jendewalt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jenniferdewalt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a></li><li><a href="/feed.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RSS</a></li></ul></div></footer></div><script src="/assets/main.31d6cfe0d16ae931b73c.js"></script></body></html>
