I'm an entrepreneur, growth hacker, and full stack developer. I taught myself to code by making 180 websites in 180 days.

While you shouldn't care about it, I bet you do... I have a Masters of Fine Arts from Pratt Institute and an undergraduate degree from the University of Maryland. What you should care about is that I played on the volleyball team at Maryland and we won the ACC tournament... twice. GO TERPS!

I'm passionate about the idea that the world can only become the best version of itself if everyone in the world becomes the best version of themselves. So, wherever you came from and wherever you are now, I highly encourage you to embrace what makes you awesome. I hope that reading the musings of a Jen helps you in your path toward self actualization, or if you're already there, I hope reading my thoughts gives you the space you need to reflect on the journey.

I grew up in Pennsylvania, but have lived all over the United States. DC, NY, LA, SF and I'm currently in MIA.

I'm not here to pontificate and posture so please email me with your thoughts. Also, if you would like to collaborate on something with me, please feel free to reach out.

Fewer words > more words!!! So I guess this is the end, lol.
